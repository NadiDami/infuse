infuse
======

This challenge formed part 1 of 2 of the Week 4 test at Makers Academy.

The aim was to open the Array class and rewrite the inject method.

I initially chose a method name of 'infuse' so as to not stop rspec from working, being that it uses the inject method to run.

The final test that I had completed the challenge was to rename all instances of 'infuse' to 'inject', except line 1 of 'infuse_spec.rb'
so that the relevant file was loaded.

All of the tests still passed, implying that 'infuse' was an accurate rewrite of the 'inject' method.
