#Infuse
##Makers Academy Week 4 Test, Part I

###Aim

The aim was to open the Array class and rewrite the inject method.

I initially chose a method name of 'infuse' so as to not prevent rspec from working, being that it uses the inject method to operate.

The final test of whether I had completed the challenge was to rename all instances of 'infuse' to 'inject', except line 1 of 'infuse_spec.rb', so that the relevant file was still loaded.

All of the tests passed, implying that 'infuse' was an accurate rewrite of the 'inject' method.

###Other details

The test was set by Enrique Comba Riepenhausen, [@ecomba](http://www.github.com/ecomba)
